00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Final Episode: Your Steering Wheel

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,230
{\an8}And this… is the final round!

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,780
I am the Advisor to the Hashiliens, Grantz Risk.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,260
Mr. Spinder's spear and shield.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,950
I am the one who minimizes all risks!

6
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,320
{\an8}Break ties with the Hashiliens.

7
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,580
{\an8}We already have their technology and contacts in space. We have nothing to lose.

8
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,940
Director of Tokoyari.

9
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,190
You were arrested for collaborating with alien invaders.

10
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,360
And where is the proof?

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,540
I have it here.

12
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,970
{\an8}This footage is being broadcast globally.

13
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,870
{\an8}This recording is being broadcast globally.
<i>I agree to the terms.</i>

14
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,850
{\an8}<i>Instead, we will accept—</i>

15
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,290
{\an8}<i>Cerdas sekali…</i>

16
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,340
{\an8}<i>Kalian manusia Bumi.</i>

17
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,700
{\an8}<i>There is no shortage of Gyaughsoline on Earth.</i>

18
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,460
{\an8}There is no shortage of Gyaughsoline on Earth.</i>
What is this…?

19
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,970
{\an8}<i>You're so naughty, aren't you? You and…</i>

20
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,310
You're tougher than I thought…

21
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,940
Saibu Shirabe.

22
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,450
I surrender myself to your authority.

23
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,270
I'm looking forward to seeing how you handle this task going forward.

24
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,120
We will not lose.

25
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,410
Not me, and not Boonboomger.

26
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,450
Don't be too sure.

27
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,140
You don't know what kind of power…

28
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,020
who supports me.

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,140
Dozer, Customize!

30
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,270
- Patrol Car 1, Customize!
- Wagon, Customize!

31
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,100
DOZER! PATROL CAR 1! WAGON!

32
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,090
It's a raging bull!

33
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,010
- Shashiro!
- Got it.

34
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,430
Great, Boon Blue!

35
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,260
But now,

36
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,680
I was filled with a power I had never felt before!

37
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,230
To protect Mr. Spinder,
whom I have entrusted my life to,

38
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,980
I am now fighting against you!

39
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,070
I've never felt this good before!

40
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,020
You've let go of your steering wheel, right?

41
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,070
In that case…

42
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,200
You can't possibly beat us!

43
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,500
SAFARI! CLASSIC!

44
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,040
Hey, there they are! And finally we catch up.

45
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,150
But what next?

46
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,950
Here is the answer!

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,070
{\an8}<i>We have the best broadcast for all of you!</i>

48
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,020
Boonboomger! Go ahead!

49
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,140
You can do it, Boonboomger!

50
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,340
Yes! You will definitely win!

51
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,010
Come on!

52
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,410
Good luck, Boonboomger!

53
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,290
Boonboomger, you can do it!

54
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,910
Ayo, Boonboomger!

55
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,820
Come on! Yes! Go!

56
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,760
I never let go of the wheel,
that's why I was able to plan our revival.

57
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,570
Kareena Kapoor…

58
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,930
And my faith in my friends!

59
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,570
SHOVEL!

60
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,140
Grantz! You let Spinder take your helm,

61
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,830
and give up on controlling yourself!

62
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,770
Do you really want all this?!

63
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,030
Mr. Spinder's will is my will...

64
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,970
Since the day I swore allegiance to him!

65
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,390
Champion Customize!

66
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,980
Bakuage Champion Drive!

67
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,740
Mr. Spinner…!

68
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,410
<i>You're not a piece of junk anymore, friend.</i>

69
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,410
<i>Kau…</i>

70
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,540
<i>Penting bagiku.</i>

71
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,400
<i>Yes, Tuan.</i>

72
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,420
<i>I will always serve…</i>

73
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,590
For your happiness, sir…!

74
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,660
Hooray! Did they succeed?

75
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,610
Yaru, you shouldn't have said that!

76
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,860
It always leads to bigger problems!

77
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,850
It's Gyaughsoline!

78
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,540
Why?! Where did it come from?

79
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,290
You are looking at the abundant screams on this small planet.

80
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,920
The Earth is amazing…

81
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,860
You can smell war in every corner.

82
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,270
And the smell of poverty…

83
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,760
Like a bottomless Gyaughsoline tank.

84
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,440
Reminds me of the slum planet I was born on.

85
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,690
Grantz…

86
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,820
You did a great job on this trip out.

87
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:56,180
Your screams have summoned others from all over the planet.

88
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,500
And all that delicious Gyaughsoline…
it’s got me back on my feet.

89
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,030
As long as the screams are still heard…

90
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,110
I am immortal.

91
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,780
When I was growing up on that slum planet,
where the screaming never stopped…

92
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,460
A thought came into my head.

93
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,410
One day…

94
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,190
I will make the whole
universe scream for me!

95
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,620
Live forever…

96
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,340
Enjoying the sound of their suffering forever.

97
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,340
As the boss of everything!

98
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,910
In that case…

99
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,030
We will change the world!

100
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,330
And create a world without screaming!

101
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,260
Sounds like loser talk, kid.

102
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,240
We will not lose.

103
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,850
We… have faith.

104
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,140
When someone screams…

105
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,310
Then someone else will come to save them!

106
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,130
And when someone saves you…

107
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,780
It makes you want to save others!

108
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,510
In this universe, we call it…

109
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,750
A little thing called love.

110
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,050
I like it.

111
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,670
If so, maybe this world can change…

112
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,300
Be a world without screams!

113
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,930
Want to join this trip…

114
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,090
Towards the world we will create?

115
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,370
Only I am allowed to drive.

116
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,200
The others…

117
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
Get this.

118
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,140
Get back up and ready for action!

119
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,640
Bean tree!

120
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,480
My dear Boon... I'm sure I killed you!

121
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,020
I did it with my own hands!

122
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,690
The call of those who believe in Boonboomger has reached Boondorio!

123
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,360
<i>You can do it! Come on! Go, Boonboomger!</i>

124
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,450
<i>Don't stop! You can do it!</i>

125
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,540
<i>Please! We believe in you!</i>

126
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,370
<i>Boonboomger! Boonboomger!</i>

127
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,370
It's the same light that comes from us.

128
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,930
Brother! We managed to bring him back!

129
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,590
Thank you, everyone around the world!

130
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,350
Your cheers made it here!

131
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,940
{\an8}<i>And I'm more excited than ever!</i>

132
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,880
Mr. Boon—!

133
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,480
The energy source only needs one last thing…

134
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,970
Everyone's support.

135
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,340
Yes. And now I know, Taiya…

136
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,860
If we all work together, we can turn
those screams into smiles!

137
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,620
We can create a world full of smiles!

138
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,810
You know how that sounds?

139
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,070
Yes.

140
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,080
Never heard anything cooler!

141
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,010
Let's go!

142
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,280
Okay!

143
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,290

Wow, look at that!

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,050
Full speed racing power!

166
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,970
Where did the screams go…?

167
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,830
Show that you are faster.

168
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,640
Hurry up and go beyond the speed limit!

169
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,430
This climax will be beautiful if delivered by both of you.

170
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,020
You can beat Spider this time!

171
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,820
We will take everyone's racing spirit…

172
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
And leave it to you guys!

173
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,570
You two are the ones who created this Speed ​​Squad.

174
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,290
So you guys have to finish it.

175
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,650
Speed ​​Champion…

176
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,130
Boonboom Drive!

177
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,070
Why don't you finish me off?

178
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,710
Because of you…

179
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,330
Still have one last responsibility.

180
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,670
Stop your colonization of the planets you have conquered.

181
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,800
Intergalactic police and courts…

182
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,350
I'm sure there are still those who are sane enough to uphold justice.

183
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,470
You have to face your punishment.

184
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,380
Well, if you want to embarrass me, that's perfect.

185
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,480
I will testify too.

186
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,900
Let's go.

187
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,250
My steering wheel…

188
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,310
Only I have the right to drive it.

189
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,600
You may be full of excitement right now…

190
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,330
But once I'm gone, this planet will go back to the way it was.

191
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,640
The same world full of fighting and screaming.

192
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,930
See you later, my dear Boon.

193
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,120
{\an8}<i>Hashiliengate: an incident where
collusion with alien invaders occurred,</i>

194
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,830
{\an8}believed to have been orchestrated by former ISA director Tokoyari Eichiro,</i>
A FEW MONTHS LATER

195
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,990
{\an8}believed to be orchestrated by former ISA director Tokoyari Eichiro,</i>

196
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,890
{\an8}<i>dan mantan CEO Lightning Tech, Naito Raita.</i>

197
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,050
{\an8}<i>Both of them claim their actions were done for the sake of Earth's development…</i>

198
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,670
Tell me…

199
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,800
Are you…

200
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,980
Always against me?

201
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,340
After meeting the Hashiliens…

202
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,860
I became greedy.

203
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,360
You better not come again.

204
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,810
This just hurts…

205
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,160
For both of us.

206
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,560
I'm going to space.

207
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,070
So I won't come again.

208
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,420
We entered BBG.

209
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,880
While I was in space,

210
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,060
I have someone I can trust to help the kids.

211
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,500
I will remain on Earth.

212
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,530
I have decided to make Taiya's dream come true.

213
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,740
Taiya's dream means...

214
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,490
Helping children around the world?

215
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,610
Yes.

216
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,960
He must quickly make Boondorio's dream come true.

217
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,020
So while he's in space, I'll be looking after the kids.

218
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,720
I understand.

219
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,540
You really are kind, Sakito.

220
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,130
Taiya can definitely have peace of mind
racing in BBG.

221
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,260
Good luck in the race,
Miss Former BBG Owner.

222
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,210
Thanks to you, proper administration has returned,

223
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,580
and Boondorio's reputation was restored.

224
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,500
Finally I can show my real driving skills!

225
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,090
- Yes
.

226
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,960
One more thing…

227
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,450
Please take care of Byoon D for me.

228
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,260
This again?

229
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,830
I am a cleaner.

230
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,790
Just go to BBG, buddy.

231
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,660
You want to race with your old friend, right?

232
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,200
We're going to a new planet!

233
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,430
We should have been our own boss from the start!

234
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,250
Yes.

235
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,290
We could call it the Three Goon Empire!

236
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,050
We are going to new frontiers
with crazy racing spirit!

237
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,930
- Yes!
- That's right!

238
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,750
Bumper to bumper!

239
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,850
- Hey, keep your hands on the wheel!
- Oh my, right!

240
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,940
- What are you doing?!
- The steering wheel is off! Ouch!

241
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,310
Congratulations on your appointment
as director of ISA headquarters.

242
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,450
Forget the formalities.

243
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,450
We won't be able to arrest the director
without the evidence you provide.

244
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,620
I've heard it all.

245
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,540
The information broker sent you, right?

246
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,330
I don't know about that.

247
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,180
I see how excited you are,
and I want to help.

248
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,840
Well, you really managed to trick me!

249
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,310
I'm a great actor, right?

250
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,220
But this is just the really hard part.

251
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,090
Good luck with that, Director!

252
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,490
Therefore, on behalf of ISA,
I would like to recruit Boonboomger.

253
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,610
Yes!

254
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,400
There are still planets suffering beneath the remnants of Hashilien…

255
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,420
I want you to give them
a feeling of incredible excitement.

256
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,640
Oh yes!

257
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,320
Consider this task…

258
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,740
Accepted.

259
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,100
We will be racing in the next BBG season. Until then…

260
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,880
We need to get this back to Nicola.

261
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,730
This time, we will be the ones to help him!

262
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,130
We also have to free your father, Genba, immediately.

263
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Yes. Thank you very much.

264
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,130
The Intergalactic Police must also be reformed.

265
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,340
Take full advantage of my information network as a cleaner.

266
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,480
A space information broker, huh…

267
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,200
Sounds cool.

268
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,170
It's finally time to make our dreams come true.

269
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,840
Yes.

270
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,730
I'll take you to BBG.

271
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,540
With everyone by our side.

272
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,390
Yes.

273
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,850
Nona Shirabe!

274
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,760
There's plenty of curry in the fridge, huh?

275
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,880
Okay! I'll eat them all.

276
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,320
Thank you for everything!
It was so nice to meet you!

277
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,410
- Me too!
- Can't breathe...!

278
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,600
Boomer!

279
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,410
- Are you okay?!
- Boondorio!

280
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,760
Are you okay, Boondorio?

281
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,640
Make sure you take the top position.

282
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,480
I just want to hear good news, okay?

283
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,170
{\an8}Very.

284
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,820
{\an8}All set!

285
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,500
{\an8}We are also ready to go.

286
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,060
{\an8}Let's go, Boonboom.

287
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,870
{\an8}- Alright!
- Here it is!

288
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,860
{\an8}Boonboomger, go!

289
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,970
{\an8}And they left.

290
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,830
{\an8}For him…

291
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,640
{\an8}Let's go back and eat that curry.

292
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,020
{\an8}Byoon!

293
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,020
{\an8}Two plates of Boonboom Curry, here.

294
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,310
{\an8}Byoon D! What about going to space?!

295
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,060
{\an8}I have some other manuscripts
I would like you to see, Sakito.

296
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,220
{\an8}Ah, you adorable brat!

297
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,620
{\an8}- The curry! The curry is going to fall!
- But the curry…!

298
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,420
<i>The first stage of the Big Bang Grand-Prix
is ​​about to begin!</i>

299
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,390
<i>After qualifying in first place,
we have a new arrival from Team Boonboomger!</i>

300
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,470
<i>High hopes to join
their first championship win!</i>

301
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,330
<i>And their first rider is… Hando Taiya!</i>

302
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,580
You can do it, Taiya!

303
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,260
Yes.

304
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,170
Let's boost your spirits!

305
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,760
Okay!
